Got the SG filter working for two examples. It works very well for uniformly distributed 
data sets. It can also be used with non-uniformly distributed data with a caveat on the 
noise (error) associated with each data point. I've started writing a class to implement
the SG filter for arbitrary data sets using my Array object to handle the data and file IO. 
This class needs to be finished.
